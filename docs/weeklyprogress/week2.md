- In the meet mentor mentioned about about the contributions of Cyril Brulebois (@kibi) and Vagrant Cascadian (@vagrant) have been doing around ARM development boards. Later, I ended up watching talks by Vagrant Cascadian, which helped me better understand how ARM development boards are supported in Debian.
