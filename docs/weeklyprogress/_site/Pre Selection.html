  <li>I came across the BeagleBoard project for this year’s Google Summer of Code and found the project titled <strong>Building Bela Images</strong> quite interesting to me and i checked <a href="https://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/Ideas-2022">BeagleBoard/GSoC/Ideas-2022 wiki</a> to find are there any initial application tasks to do anything related to Building Bela Image and asked in beagleboard-gsoc slack channel to provide me with some small tasks related to the project to do.</li>
  <li>Got in touch with Giulio Moro and Dhruva Gole, started looking at <a href="https://github.com/BelaPlatform">Bela Platform</a> projects and tried to understand the sprit behind these debian based distributions (bela, beagleboard images) and listed out features, somehow got familiar with code base.</li>
  <li>Setuped build environment on my machine to rebuild bela, beagleboard images and I tried some ways to boot Images using QEMU emulator and that didn’t worked out as I don’t have hardware to test the image.</li>
  <li>I acquainted myself with BeagleBoard.org and Bela.io and what products and services they both offer.</li>
  <li>Drafted my <a href="https://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/2022_Proposal/Building_Bela_Images">proposal</a> and asked for suggestion and feedback from Guiliomoro and Dhruva Goel.</li>
  <li>After, feedback I updated my proposal with necessary corrections and necessary topics to work on as mentioned and submitted proposal on GSoC website.</li>
